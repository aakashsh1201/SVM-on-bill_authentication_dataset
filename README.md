Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.
The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.
This repository depicts implementation of the algorithm for both linear and polynomial features.
